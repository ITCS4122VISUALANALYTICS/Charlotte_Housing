Introduction Section
	- Motivation
	- Goal
	- Soft Data Introduction
Overview Section
    Plots that show specific insights
Exploration Section
	- Interactive plots
		Histogram of single feature
			Allow color to be changed to various targets
		Scatter of two features
			Allow color to be changed based on targets
			Simple regression on given features too???
		Heatmap
			select subset of features to compare
        Radial Chart
            - https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/radial_chart.html
		Other simple plots??
	- Include notes on how to interpret each?
	- Use cleaned or uncleaned data?
	- Need to allow value acronyms to be converted on the spot OR convert them already
Model Analysis
    Summarize results of models in a single interactive plot... (feature importance)
	- Allow for users to predict rent based on subset of features
		- paired with plots?
	- Allow users to predict if cost burdened based on features	
		- paired with plots?
	- Allow users to determine if a house is considered affordable based on features
	-	- paired with plots?
	- Analysis of Classification on COSTBURD_ALL
	- Analysis of Regression on rent
	- Analysis of Regression on affordability
    - Clustering
        - Interactive PCA of Clusters

What contributes to cost burdened status?

What contributes to the affordability?

What contributes to price of rent?

How is the data naturally clustered?

TODO:
    - Create dictionary function to convert raw values to strings from dictionary
    - Start to think about limiting feature selection for sandbox, for usability
