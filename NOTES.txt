	- Soft Data Introduction
Exploration Section
	- Interactive plots
		Histogram of single feature
			Allow color to be changed to various targets
		Scatter of two features
			Allow color to be changed based on targets
			Simple regression on given features too???
		Heatmap
			select subset of features to compare
		Other simple plots??
	- Include notes on how to interpret each?
	- Use cleaned or uncleaned data?
	- Need to allow value acronyms to be converted on the spot OR convert them already
